# AI Agentic Workflow Engine - Domain Driven Design Analysis

## Overview
This document outlines the domain-driven design (DDD) analysis for the AI Agentic Workflow Engine used in financial business scenarios. The system is designed to handle complex business processes including intelligent customer service, credit approval, and fraud detection.

## Key Business Requirements
- Intelligent customer service with multi-round conversations (avg. 8 rounds/session)
- Automated processing of 20+ business scenarios (credit approval, fraud detection, etc.)
- Process time reduction from 3 days to 15 minutes
- Support for 2000+ concurrent sessions
- Response latency < 1 second
- 99.99% annual availability

## Strategic Design

### Core Domains
1. **AI Agent Domain** (Core)
   - Responsible for agent management and coordination
   - Handles agent communication and context sharing
   - Critical for business differentiation

2. **Workflow Engine Domain** (Core)
   - Manages business process workflows
   - Orchestrates agent interactions
   - Core business process automation

3. **Credit Assessment Domain** (Core)
   - Handles credit approval processes
   - Risk assessment integration
   - Critical financial decision making

4. **Customer Service Domain** (Supporting)
   - Manages customer interactions
   - Handles conversation flows
   - Support for core business processes

5. **Risk Management Domain** (Supporting)
   - Risk calculation and assessment
   - Fraud detection
   - Compliance monitoring

### Bounded Contexts
1. **Agent Context**
   - Agent lifecycle management
   - Agent communication protocols
   - Context sharing mechanisms

2. **Workflow Context**
   - Workflow definitions
   - Process orchestration
   - State management

3. **Credit Context**
   - Credit assessment rules
   - Approval workflows
   - Risk integration

4. **Customer Service Context**
   - Conversation management
   - Response generation
   - User interaction history

5. **Risk Context**
   - Risk calculation
   - Fraud detection rules
   - Compliance checks

## Tactical Design
